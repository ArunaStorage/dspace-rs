/*
 * Transfer Completion Message
 * Sent by:    Consumer, Provider
 * Results in: COMPLETED
 * Response:   ACK or ERROR
 * Schema:     TTL Shape, JSON Schema
 *
 * The Transfer Completion Message is sent by the Provider or Consumer when a data transfer has completed.
 * Note that some Connector implementations may optimize completion notification by performing it as part of their wire protocol.
 * In those cases, a Transfer Completion Message does not need to be sent.
