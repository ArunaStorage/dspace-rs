/*
 * Connectors implementing the Dataspace Protocol may operate on different versions.
 * Therefore, it is necessary that they can discover the supported versions of each other reliably and unambiguously.
 * Each Connector must expose information of at least one Dataspace Protocol Version it supports.
 * The specifics of how this information is obtained its defined by specific protocol bindings.
 *
 * A Connector must respond to a respective request by providing a JSON-LD object containing an array of supported versions with at least one item.
 * The item connects the version tag (version attribute) with the absolute URL path segment of the root path for all endpoints of this version.
 * The following example specifies that this Connector offers version 1.0 endpoints at <host>/some/path/v1.
 *
 * The requesting Connector may select from the endpoints in the response.
 * If the Connector can't identify a matching Dataspace Protocol Version, it must terminate the communication.
