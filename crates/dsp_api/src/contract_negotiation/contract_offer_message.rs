/*
 * Contract Offer Message
 * Sent by:    Provider
 * Results in: AGREED, TERMINATED
 * Response:   ACK or ERROR
 * Schema:     TTL Shape, JSON Schema
 *
 * The Contract Offer Message is sent by a Provider to initiate a CN or to respond to a Contract Request Message sent by a Consumer.
 *
 * If the message includes a consumerPid property, the request will be associated with an existing CN.
 * If the message does not include a consumerPid, a new CN will be created on Consumer side and the Consumer selects an appropriate consumerPid.
 *
 * The Dataset id is not required but can be included when the Provider initiates a CN.
 *
 * Different to a Dataset (see DCAT Vocabulry Mapping), the Offer inside a ContractOfferMessage must have an odrl:target attribute.
 * However, it's contained Rules must not have any odrl:target attributes to prevent inconsistencies with the ODRL inferencing rules for compact policies.
