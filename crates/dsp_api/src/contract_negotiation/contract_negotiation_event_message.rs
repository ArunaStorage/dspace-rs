/*
 * Contract Negotiation Event Message
 * Sent by:    Provider, Consumer
 * Results in: FINALIZED, ACCEPTED, TERMINATED
 * Response:   ACK or ERROR
 * Schema:     TTL Shape, JSON Schema
 *
 * When the Contract Negotiation Event Message is sent by a Provider with an eventType property set to FINALIZED,
 * an Agreement has been finalized and the associated Dataset is accessible.
 * The state machine is transitioned to the FINALIZED state.
 *
 * Other event types may be defined in the future.
 *
 * A Consumer responds with an error if the contract cannot be validated or is incorrect.
 *
 * The message must contain a consumerPid and a providerPid.
 *
 * When the message is sent by a Consumer with an eventType set to ACCEPTED, the state machine is placed in the ACCEPTED state.
 *
 * It is an error for a Consumer to send the message with an event type FINALIZED to the Provider.
 *
 * It is an error for a Provider to send the message with an event type ACCEPTED to the Consumer.
 *
 * Note that CN events are not intended for propagation of an Agreement state after a CN has entered a terminal state.
 * It is considered an error for a Consumer or Provider to send an event after the CN state machine has entered a terminal state.
