/*
 * Contract Request Message
 * Sent by:    Consumer
 * Results in: REQUESTED, TERMINATED
 * Response:   ACK or ERROR
 * Schema:     TTL Shape, JSON Schema
 *
 * The Contract Request Message is sent by a Consumer to initiate a CN or to respond to a Contract Offer Message sent by a Provider.
 *
 * The Consumer must include an offer property, which itself must have an @id property.
 *
 * If the message includes a providerPid property, the request will be associated with an existing CN
 * and a Consumer Offer will be created using either the offer or offer.@id properties.
 *
 * If the message does not include a providerPid, a new CN will be created on Provider side using
 * either the offer or offer.@id properties and the Provider selects an appropriate providerPid.
 *
 * An offer.@id will generally refer to an Offer contained in a Catalog.
 * If the Provider is not aware of the offer.@id value, it must respond with an error message.
 *
 * The callbackAddress is a URL indicating where messages to the Consumer should be sent in asynchronous settings.
 * If the address is not understood, the Provider MUST return an UNRECOVERABLE error.
 *
 * Different to a Catalog or Dataset, the Offer inside a Contract Request Message must have an odrl:target attribute.
 * However, it's contained Rules must not have any odrl:target attributes to prevent inconsistencies with the ODRL inferencing rules for compact policies.
