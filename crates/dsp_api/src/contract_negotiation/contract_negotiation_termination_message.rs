/*
 * Contract Negotiation Event Message
 * Sent by:    Consumer, Provider
 * Results in: TERMINATED
 * Response:   ACK or ERROR
 * Schema:     TTL Shape, JSON Schema
 *
 * The Contract Negotiation Termination Message is sent by a Consumer or Provider indicating it has cancelled the CN sequence.
 * The message can be sent at any state of a CN without providing an explanation.
 * Nevertheless, the sender may provide a description to help the receiver.
 *
 * The message must contain a consumerPid and a providerPid.
 *
 * If an error is received in response to the message, the sending party may choose to ignore the error.
 *
 * Note that a CN may be terminated for a variety of reasons, for example, an unrecoverable error was encountered or one of the parties no longer wishes to continue.
 * A Connector's operator may remove terminated CN resources after it has reached the terminated state.
