/*
 * Contract Agreement Message
 * Sent by:    Provider
 * Results in: AGREED, TERMINATED
 * Response:   ACK or ERROR
 * Schema:     TTL Shape, JSON Schema
 *
 * The Contract Agreement Message is sent by a Provider when it agrees to a contract. It contains the complete Agreement.
 *
 * The message must contain a consumerPid and a providerPid.
 *
 * The message must contain an ODRL Agreement.
 *
 * An Agreement must contain a timestamp property defined as an XSD DateTime type.
 *
 * An Agreement must contain an assigner and assignee. The contents of these properties are a dataspace-specific unique identifier of the Agreement parties.
 * Note that these identifiers are not necessarily the same as the identifiers of the Participant Agents negotiating the contract (e.g., Connectors).
 *
 * An Agreement must contain a odrl:target property. None of its Rules, however, must have any odrl:target attributes to prevent inconsistencies with the ODRL inferencing rules for compact policies.
